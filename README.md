## Abstract
Abstract—Anxiety, a pervasive and complex emotional state,
poses significant challenges to individuals’ mental health and
well-being. This paper delves into the multifaceted nature of anxiety,
exploring its physiological, psychological, and computational
aspects. Through an extensive literature review and analysis of
diverse datasets—including acted scenarios, naturalistic observations,
and validated scientific resources—the paper sheds light
on the varied expressions of anxiety across different contexts
and modalities. It highlights the crucial role of social signals,
such as facial expressions, body language, and vocal patterns,
in conveying anxiety, alongside the biological underpinnings that
drive these manifestations.
The paper further examines computational approaches to
processing and synthesizing anxiety, showcasing the potential of
machine learning in analyzing facial expressions and biosignals to
predict anxiety levels. It also evaluates the application of wearable
technology integrated with artificial intelligence for non-invasive
anxiety detection, emphasizing the need for personalized and
context-aware computational models.
Addressing the current limitations and exploring potential
extensions, the paper calls for a more nuanced understanding of
anxiety that considers cultural and contextual factors. It suggests
interdisciplinary approaches that blend affective computing with
psychology, neuroscience, and cultural studies to unravel the
complexities of anxiety. By highlighting open research questions
and discussing emerging technologies like augmented and virtual
reality, the paper underscores the importance of advancing our
understanding and management of anxiety, paving the way for
innovative therapeutic interventions and enhanced mental health
support.
